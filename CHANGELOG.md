# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Updated screenshot template to include the current date and time. The file name is crazy long now, so I might change this later.

## [1.1.0] - 2021-10-07

### Added

- [`autoload.lua`](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/blob/master/TOOLS/lua/autoload.lua) script that automatically makes a playlist of other files from the folder the currently played file is in. (Tongue twister!)

## [1.0.0] - 2021-08-29

First version! ðŸ¥³ After I reformatted my computer, I recreated the configuration I've been using since the summer of 2020.
